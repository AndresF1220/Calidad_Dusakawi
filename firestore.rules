/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Dusakawi Quality Central.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (alerts, feedback).
 * Quality metrics and data points are publicly readable, but only authorized users can create, update, or delete them.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the user and potentially admins (not yet implemented).
 * - /qualityMetrics/{qualityMetricId}: Stores definitions of quality metrics. Publicly readable, owner-only writable (if an ownership field existed).
 * - /qualityMetrics/{qualityMetricId}/dataPoints/{dataPointId}: Stores data points for quality metrics. Publicly readable, owner-only writable (if an ownership field existed).
 * - /users/{userId}/alerts/{alertId}: Stores alerts configured by users. Access is restricted to the user and potentially admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/feedback/{feedbackId}: Stores user feedback. Access is restricted to the user and potentially admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, update, or delete their own profiles, alerts, and feedback.
 * - Listing of user profiles is disallowed.
 * - Quality metrics and data points are publicly readable.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields during the prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - While the data model doesn't explicitly require it yet, imagine a scenario where a `QualityMetric` could only be modified by its creator. In that case, we would add an `ownerId` field to the `QualityMetric` document and validate it in the rules. The `QualityDataPoint` would also need to inherit this `ownerId` for consistent authorization.
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - User-specific data (alerts, feedback) is stored under /users/{userId} to ensure path-based ownership, simplifying security rules.
